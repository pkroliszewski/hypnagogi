# Hypnagogi

**Hypnagogi** is an experimental visual simulation inspired by **hypnagogic states** — the transition between wakefulness and sleep, in which visual perception stops responding to external stimuli and begins to generate **autonomous light structures**.

The project focuses exclusively on **plasma and glow**:
- no objects,
- no narrative,
- no symbolism,
- no center of attention.

It is a visualization of a process, not an image.

## What is hypnagogia?

Hypnagogia is a liminal state between wakefulness and sleep, in which:
- the visual cortex shifts into endogenous activity,
- phosphenes, waves, fogs, and luminous structures appear,
- images lack narrative meaning,
- perception focuses on **movement, intensity, and spatial relationships**.

Many people describe this state as:
- a bluish-cyan “mist,”
- black, contentless regions,
- subtle glow at the boundaries of forms,
- slow, pulsating changes without a clear direction.

**Hypnagogi** attempts to evoke precisely this type of experience — as neutrally and minimally as possible.

## What does the program do?

The program renders in real time:

- **a spatially static plasma** (the texture does not move),
- **dynamic glow and shimmer** (intensity changes, not position),
- a dominant palette of **dark blues and cyans**,
- no sharp edges and no central focal point,
- very slow, continuous image evolution.

There are no objects, figures, or “events.”  
The image **simply persists and gently reorganizes itself**.

## Project characteristics

- inspired by neurophenomenology, not psychedelics
- deterministic (no random jumps)
- low contrast, no aggressive changes
- intended for calm observation

The project can be treated as:
- a tool for exploring liminal states,
- a visual experiment,
- a background for meditation or reflection,
- research or aesthetic material.
